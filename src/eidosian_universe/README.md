# ðŸŒŒ Eidosian Universe

A lightweight sandbox where autonomous agents evolve within a minimalistic cosmos.

## Features

- **Emergent behavior** driven by complex agent properties and resource dynamics.
- **Adaptive AI** periodically refines gravity, metabolism, and temperature.
- **Procedural bodies**: agents consist of multiple components with mass and efficiency.
- **Interactive controls**: click or tap to spawn agents, `ESC` to exit.
- **Procedural resources** fuel agent growth and reproduction.
- **Dynamic environment** with temperature influencing metabolism.
- **Minimal requirements**: Python 3.10+, Pygame.

## Running

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m eidosian_universe.eu_main
```

The game launches in fullscreen by default. Click or tap anywhere to spawn
additional agents.
